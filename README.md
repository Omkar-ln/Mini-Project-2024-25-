Arduino Radar using an Ultrasonic Sensor is a low-cost system designed for obstacle detection and distance measurement. It uses Arduino Nano, HC-SR04 sensor, and a servo motor to scan and display object positions on a radar-like GUI. Applications include robotics, UAVs, and proximity warning systems.
