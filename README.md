# Mini-Project(2024-25)
Arduino Radar using an Ultrasonic Sensor is a low-cost system designed for obstacle detection and distance measurement. It uses Arduino Nano, HC-SR04 sensor, and a servo motor to scan and display object positions on a radar-like GUI. Applications include robotics, UAVs, and proximity warning systems.

1.1	MOTIVATION
The motivation behind building an Arduino Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging) System using an ultrasonic sensor comes from a curiosity to understand how radar systems function in detecting objects and measuring distances. Traditional radar systems rely on electromagnetic waves, such as radio waves, to locate objects. However, using an ultrasonic sensor offers a more practical, cost-effective solution, especially for projects where precision over shorter distances is needed. This approach allows for a deeper exploration of radar technology in a simplified, accessible way, making it easier to learn and experiment with in everyday applications.

1.2	PROBLEM STATEMENT
In aviation, ensuring the safe operation of aircraft during takeoff, landing, and in-flight maneuvers is a top priority. One of the key challenges is detecting obstacles and monitoring distances to prevent collisions, whether with objects on the ground, in the air, or during ground operations like taxiing. By effectively monitoring the surroundings, aviation systems can help pilots make informed decisions, improve safety, and reduce the risk of accidents. This is especially crucial when visibility is limited or in complex operational environments, where quick responses are necessary to avoid potential hazards
